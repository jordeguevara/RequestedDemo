Using a simple button and textfield for user input, the basic UI allows the user to change the title in the middle of the screen with their own custom input.
The web page is connected to Firebase, which stores the value of custom input and saves it to the DB on the cloud. On refresh the custom value replaces the older value


## Going forward 
Adding authentication to allow certain users to change it if hosted on Heroku
As of right now, I can change it because I have the creditentials
