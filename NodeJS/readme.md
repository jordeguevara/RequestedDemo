Using the fs library in Node, created a program that would verify whether a file extension was accepted. It would check if file extension was in an array of acceptable extension. 
If it wasn't it would print out the types that were accepted. 

Example: 
index.js 
program: accepted!

main.c
program: Invaild! Valid in puts are ....
