Using the fs library in Node, created a program that would verify whether a file extension was accepted. It would check if file extension was in an array of acceptable extensions. 
If it wasn't it would print out the types that were accepted. 

Example: index.js 

program: accepted!

==================================

Example2: main.c

program: Invaild! Valid in puts are ....me instead of creating the dummy file. 

TODO: use commandline to check for user input of file na

Handle cases where it has more than one extension to throw exceptions to let user know
